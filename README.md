# ProcureX AI – MERN Stack Project

## Project Description
**ProcureX AI** is a web‐based platform that aggregates pricing and SKU data from cleaning‐supply vendors and proprietary client sources, then delivers real‐time benchmarking, analytics, and PDF reporting. A student developer will build this end‐to‐end solution using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Each of the following requirements represents a milestone.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Interface
- [ ] **Design & deploy** a simple, intuitive dashboard for real‑time insights and visualizations  
  - React components for charts and tables  
  - Use a charting library (e.g. Recharts, Chart.js)  

### 2. Data Import Tool
- [ ] **Develop** a module to ingest CSV, Excel, or proprietary files  
  - Express API endpoints for file upload  
  - Parse with `csv-parser` or `xlsx`
  - Persist raw and normalized data in MongoDB  

### 3. Basic Benchmarking
- [ ] **Implement** comparison features for pricing, SKUs, and market trends  
  - Backend filtering and aggregation endpoints  
  - Frontend rendering of comparison tables and trend graphs  

### 4. Essential Reporting
- [ ] **Enable** PDF report generation summarizing market data and client metrics  
  - Leverage `pdfkit` or `jsPDF`  
  - Provide “Download Report” functionality in the dashboard
    
### 5. User Authentication
- [ ] **Integrate** secure authentication for authorized access  
  - React login/register pages
